          Diamond Lake Resort has evolved from a small fishing lodge built in the 1920s, to a modern family resort that offers year-round service.  It is a favorite summer spot for fishing (rainbow trout), hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding.  In the winter it is famous for skiing, snowboarding and tubing, snowmobiling, and snowshoeing.</p><p>All year round it is a wonderful place to take in the beauty of nature and of Crater Lake National Park.
          We offer 38 two bedroom guest cabins; one deluxe four bedroom family cabin; one super deluxe 7 bedroom lakefront retreat cabin.  We also have 38 motel rooms, 10 house keeping studios and one deluxe Jacuzzi suite.
